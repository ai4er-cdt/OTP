*MODELS TO BE TRAINED*

STATIC / ONE-STEP / MULTI-STEP
- linear regression
- solodoch architecture (if this is as overparameterised as it seems, we should study stuff like F.I. and report on it)
- 1D CNN (time w/ avg. lon) (lon w/ static model)
- 2D CNN (time + lon) (time + lat w/ avg. lon) (lat + lon w/ static model)
- 3D CNN (time + lat + lon)
- reservoir computing
- [RNN: we should only really think about this once the others are done]

[AUTOREGRESSIVE]
- train on and for moc strength only
- train on and for satellite variables only -> pair with a static model for moc strength

----------

TRAINING VARIANTS

- train/val/test on desired latitude
- train on different latitudes, val/test on desired latitude
